# Offensive Aura Barbarian
This mod introduces a significant twist to Diablo 2 Resurrected by creating two new classes through a skill tree swap:

- Combat Skills, Combat Masteries and Offensive Auras Barbarian: This class focuses on enhancing the Barbarian's combat skills and offensive capabilities, allowing for a more aggressive playstyle.
- Combat Skills, Warcies and Defensive Auras Paladin:  This class emphasizes the Paladin's defensive abilities and war cries, providing a more supportive and tanky role in gameplay.

These new classes provide players with fresh gameplay experiences and exciting build opportunities.

You can craft a Token of Absolution (used for stat and skill resets) by cubing a Town Portal Scroll with an Identify Scroll in the Horadric Cube.
